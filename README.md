The WinForms of Isaac is a fan-made recreation of a 'The Binding of Isaac' Boss Fight, but using WinForms.

## 📝 Technology Explanation
The most technical part is the Boss' **moving pattern**, which changes its direction when it hits the wall.

The hitboxes for the main Character, its Attack and the Boss are made with the `Rectangle` object, to detect collisions with others.

In the [code]()'s comments, all the moving pattern and functionality is explained.

## 🛠️ Setup
Just download the binary file from the [Releases](https://github.com/LuisMiSanVe/The_WinForms_of_Isaac/releases) or from the [itch.io Page](https://kommagames.itch.io/the-winforms-of-isaac) and play!

You can also clone this repository and compile it yourself in [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

## 🎮 Project Usage Explanation
There is an in-game controls aid, which pops up a window with all the game's controls by pressing the `C` key.\
These are the controls:
- W,A,S,D: Move the Character.
- Arrows: Move the Attack.
- E: Place bombs.
- Space: Accept/Skip.
- Escape: Exit.

## 📖 About the Project
This is one of the projects I made while studying for my Programming degree. It involved creating an object that bounces off the screen's edges and changes its direction accordingly.

This project is merely a school prototype and does not attempt (nor succeed) in replicating the original game's gameplay, visuals, or audio quality. Its purpose is solely to demonstrate that a fairly simple game can be created using technology not specifically designed for gaming, such as WinForms.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>All the sprites of the game are made from scratch, based on the original game's textures.
>
>You can [buy the original game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth) to support their great work!
